# Lets Go Gambling! - RoR2 SFX Mod.

## What does this do?
Plays the AW YEAH YEAH sfx or aw dang it sfx when you succeed or fail a shrine.

Fully Networked, should play for others when you hit the shrine of chance.

If there are any bugs, let me know in the RoR2 modding discord, or directly at `ethanol10`.
