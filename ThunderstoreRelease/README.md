# Lets Go Gambling! - RoR2 SFX Mod.

## What does this do?
Plays the AW YEAH YEAH sfx or aw dang it sfx when you succeed or fail a shrine.
Also plays "I can't stop winning!" when getting a successive win.

Fully Networked, should play for others when you hit the shrine of chance.

If there are any bugs, let me know in the RoR2 modding discord, or directly at `ethanol10`.

## Latest Release:
- v1.1.0:
    - Added one more sound effect when getting subsequent successes from chance shrines. Resets if failed.
        - This affects everyone's success/failure, not just your own.
